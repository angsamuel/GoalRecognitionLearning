---- Commands to generate PDF ----

Old way:

bibtex main
latex main
latex main
dvips -t letter -Pamz -Pcmz -Ppdf -j0 -G0 main -o main.pdf.ps
ps2pdf main.pdf.ps main.pdf

(You can then delete main.pdf.ps and main.dvi.)


New way:

pdflatex main
bibtex main
pdflatex main
pdflatex main


---- Other comments and information ----

main.tex is, somewhat obviously, the "main" file.  Look for comments
"FIX THIS" in all files to find places where you would put your
own stuff.

The signatures page should be checked against the most recent official
version, in particular the prose at the bottom.
