Motivated by the goal recognition (GR) 
and goal recognition design (GRD) problems 
in the artificial intelligence (AI) planning domain, 
we introduced and studied two natural variants of the 
GR and GRD problems with strategic agents. We considered game-theoretic (GT)
scenarios where a malicious adversary 
is aiming to cause damage to some target in an
(physical or virtual) environment monitored by a defender. We modeled GTGR and GTGRD settings as zero-sum stochastic games
with incomplete information regarding the adversary's intended target. We presented two solutions to the GTGRD setting. The mixed integer program gave optimal results when restricting the observer to stationary strategies. The dual-based greedy heuristic was capable of achieving similar performance with far better scalability. We also introduced a partially observable variant of the GTGR setting with imperfect information regarding the agent's location. The Whale method for approaching partially observable scenarios offered an inexpensive solution. The Transmogrification, though incredibly expensive offered better results. Though currently impractical, the Transmogrification method could become viable with the addition of selective pruning.
